# Populous
A Godot addon to create NPCs with their Personal Data.

Populous uses something called 'Populous Resources' to define how your NPCs will look and act. Each Populous Resource has two main parts: the generator and the meta. The generator decides how the NPCs will be created, and the meta gives them their unique details. To create your own custom NPCs, you'll extend the base Populous Generator and Populous Meta to create your own unique logic. We provide some extended examples, like the random generator and random meta, to get you started. Populous also comes with a tool that converts JSON data into resources, which makes it even easier to get started.
