# Populous

A Godot addon to create NPCs with their personal data.

## Overview

Populous provides a powerful system for defining NPCs with unique appearances and behaviors. It introduces **Populous Resources**, which consist of two key components:

- **Generator** – Determines how NPCs are created.
- **Meta** – Defines the unique details of each NPC.

To create custom NPCs, extend the base **Populous Generator** and **Populous Meta** classes with your own logic. To help you get started, Populous includes example extensions, such as a random generator and random meta.

Additionally, Populous features a **JSON-to-Resource converter**, enabling easy conversion of JSON data into usable resources.

## Features

- Modular NPC creation system
- Extendable generators and meta definitions
- Built-in random NPC generator
- JSON-to-Resource conversion tool
- Seamless integration with Godot
